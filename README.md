# Hi there! 👋 I'm Kenny  

🚀 **15+ Years of Experience** crafting maintainable software solutions with **high-quality standards.**  
⚡ **Creator of [Atomic Agents](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde/atomic_agents)** – A framework for building AI Agents with **full programmatic control, minimal abstraction,** and **zero confusion.**  
❤️ Lover of **Quality Code** and **Good Architecture** built on **Solid Design Patterns.**

If you love what I do and want to support me, please consider [**donating**](https://www.paypal.me/KennyVaneetvelde). Your support is very deeply appreciated & goes a very long way in helping me continue building open-source tools and advancing the AI community!  


## 💡 Featured Projects  
- [**Atomic Agents**](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde/atomic_agents) - A modular framework for building agentic AI with control, flexibility, and developer ownership.  
- [**Whisperer**](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde/groq_whisperer) - A small script that I always run in the background that uses Whisper on Groq (for free) to save me a ton of typing on a day-to-day basis.  
- [**Video Frame Skipper**](https://github.com/KennyVaneetvelde/video_frame_skipper) - A tool I wrote for my wife to automatically cut out duplicate frames out of digital art process recordings - resulting in a smooth video without any dead moments.


## 🌱 Currently Exploring  
I’m always enhancing **Atomic Agents** – experimenting with new features and ideas to push the boundaries of agentic AI systems.  
Currently experimenting a lot with **Multi-Agent Systems**, **Long-Term Memory**, **Custom Fine-Tuned Local Models** and more!
